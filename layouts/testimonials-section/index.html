          I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were
          current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I
          got every penny’s worth.

        I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been
        looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an
        amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found
        it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was
        the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the
        course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software
        Engineer at a VR startup.

        I started as a total newbie with virtually no coding skills. I now work
        as a mobile engineer for a big company. This was one of the best
        investments I’ve made in myself.

          Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves.
          Getting guidance from them and learning from their experiences was
          easy.

        The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really
        refreshing. The program gave me the confidence necessary to be able to
        go out in the world and present myself as a capable junior developer.
        The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you
        need from an incredible community of smart and amazing people.

        Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed
        some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step
        by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who
        can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum
        and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to
        wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was
        outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no
        tutorial could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during
        interviews as an example of my development experience. It certainly
        helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple
        offers. 100% recommend!
