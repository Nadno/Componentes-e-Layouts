          <h2>Apples</h2>

          <p>
            An apple is an edible fruit produced by an apple tree (Malus
            domestica). Apple trees are cultivated worldwide and are the most
            widely grown species in the genus Malus. The tree originated in
            Central Asia, where its wild ancestor, Malus sieversii, is still
            found today. Apples have been grown for thousands of years in Asia
            and Europe and were brought to North America by European colonists.
            Apples have religious and mythological significance in many
            cultures, including Norse, Greek, and European Christian tradition.
          </p>

          <p>
            Apples grown from seed tend to be very different from those of the
            parents, and the resultant fruit frequently lack desired
            characteristics. Generally then, apple cultivars are propagated by
            clonal grafting onto rootstocks. Apple trees grown without
            rootstocks tend to be larger and much slower to fruit after
            planting. Rootstocks are used to control speed of growth and the
            size of the resulting tree allowing for easier harvesting.

          <h2>Oranges</h2>
          <p>
            An orange is a fruit of various citrus species in the family
            Rutaceae (see list of plants known as orange); it primarily refers
            to Citrus sinensis, which is also called sweet orange, to
            distinguish it from the related Citrus aurantium, referred to as
            bitter orange. The sweet orange reproduces asexually (apomixis
            through nucellar embryony); varieties of sweet orange arise through
            mutations.
          </p>

          <p>
            The orange is a hybrid between pomelo (Citrus maxima) and mandarin
            (Citrus reticulata). The chloroplast genome, and therefore the
            maternal line, is that of pomelo. The sweet orange has had its full
            genome sequenced.
          </p>

          <p>
            The orange originated in a region encompassing Southern China,
            Northeast India, and Myanmar, and the earliest mention of the sweet
            orange was in Chinese literature in 314 BC. As of 1987, orange trees
            were found to be the most cultivated fruit tree in the world.[10]
            Orange trees are widely grown in tropical and subtropical climates
            for their sweet fruit. The fruit of the orange tree can be eaten
            fresh, or processed for its juice or fragrant peel.[11] As of 2012,
            sweet oranges accounted for approximately 70% of citrus
            production.[12]

          <h2>Strawberries</h2>

          <p>
            The garden strawberry (or simply strawberry; Fragaria ananassa) is
            a widely grown hybrid species of the genus Fragaria, collectively
            known as the strawberries, which are cultivated worldwide for their
            fruit. The fruit is widely appreciated for its characteristic aroma,
            bright red color, juicy texture, and sweetness. It is consumed in
            large quantities, either fresh or in such prepared foods as jam,
            juice, pies, ice cream, milkshakes, and chocolates. Artificial
            strawberry flavorings and aromas are also widely used in products
            such as candy, soap, lip gloss, perfume, and many others.
          </p>

          <p>
            The garden strawberry was first bred in Brittany, France, in the
            1750s via a cross of Fragaria virginiana from eastern North America
            and Fragaria chiloensis, which was brought from Chile by
            Am√©d√©e-Fran√ßois Fr√©zier in 1714. Cultivars of Fragaria ananassa
            have replaced, in commercial production, the woodland strawberry
            (Fragaria vesca), which was the first strawberry species cultivated
            in the early 17th century.

          <h2>Watermelons</h2>

          <p>
            Watermelon (Citrullus lanatus) is a flowering plant species of the
            Cucurbitaceae family and the name of its edible fruit. A scrambling
            and trailing vine-like plant, it is a highly cultivated fruit
            worldwide, with more than 1,000 varieties.
          </p>

          <p>
            Watermelon is grown in favorable climates from tropical to temperate
            regions worldwide for its large edible fruit, which is a berry with
            a hard rind and no internal divisions, and is botanically called a
            pepo. The sweet, juicy flesh is usually deep red to pink, with many
            black seeds, although seedless varieties exist. The fruit can be
            eaten raw or pickled, and the rind is edible after cooking. It may
            also be consumed as a juice or as an ingredient in mixed beverages.
          </p>

          <p>
            Watermelons are thought to be native to northeastern Africa. Wild
            watermelon seeds have been found in Uan Muhuggiag, a prehistoric
            site in Libya that dates to approximately 3500 BC. Watermelons were
            domesticated in Egypt by 2000 BC, and sweet dessert watermelons
            spread across the Mediterranean world during Roman times.
          </p>

          <p>
            Considerable breeding effort has developed disease-resistant
            varieties. Many cultivars are available that produce mature fruit
            within 100 days of planting. In 2017, China produced about
            two-thirds of the world total of watermelons.

          <h2>Avocados</h2>

          <p>
            The avocado (Persea americana), a tree likely originating from
            south-central Mexico, is classified as a member of the flowering
            plant family Lauraceae. The fruit of the plant, also called an
            avocado (or avocado pear or alligator pear), is botanically a large
            berry containing a single large seed. Avocado trees are partially
            self-pollinating, and are often propagated through grafting to
            maintain predictable fruit quality and quantity.
          </p>

          <p>
            Avocados are cultivated in tropical and Mediterranean climates of
            many countries, with Mexico as the leading producer of avocados in
            2019, supplying 32% of the world total.
          </p>

          <p>
            The fruit of domestic varieties has a buttery flesh when ripe.
            Depending on the variety, avocados have green, brown, purplish, or
            black skin when ripe, and may be pear-shaped, egg-shaped, or
            spherical. Commercially, the fruits are picked while immature, and
            ripened after harvesting.

          <h2>Bananas</h2>
          <p>
            A banana is an elongated, edible fruit ‚Äì botanically a berry ‚Äì
            produced by several kinds of large herbaceous flowering plants in
            the genus Musa. In some countries, bananas used for cooking may be
            called "plantains", distinguishing them from dessert bananas. The
            fruit is variable in size, color, and firmness, but is usually
            elongated and curved, with soft flesh rich in starch covered with a
            rind, which may be green, yellow, red, purple, or brown when ripe.
            The fruits grow upward in clusters near the top of the plant. Almost
            all modern edible seedless (parthenocarp) bananas come from two wild
            species ‚Äì Musa acuminata and Musa balbisiana. The scientific names
            of most cultivated bananas are Musa acuminata, Musa balbisiana, and
            Musa paradisiaca for the hybrid Musa acuminata M. balbisiana,
            depending on their genomic constitution. The old scientific name for
            this hybrid, Musa sapientum, is no longer used.
          </p>

          <p>
            Musa species are native to tropical Indomalaya and Australia, and
            are likely to have been first domesticated in Papua New Guinea. They
            are grown in 135 countries, primarily for their fruit, and to a
            lesser extent to make fiber, banana wine, and banana beer and as
            ornamental plants. The world's largest producers of bananas in 2017
            were India and China, which together accounted for approximately 38%
            of total production.
          </p>

          <p>
            Worldwide, there is no sharp distinction between "bananas" and
            "plantains". Especially in the Americas and Europe, "banana" usually
            refers to soft, sweet, dessert bananas, particularly those of the
            Cavendish group, which are the main exports from banana-growing
            countries. By contrast, Musa cultivars with firmer, starchier fruit
            are called "plantains". In other regions, such as Southeast Asia,
            many more kinds of banana are grown and eaten, so the binary
            distinction is not as useful and is not made in local languages.
          </p>

          <p>
            The term "banana" is also used as the common name for the plants
            that produce the fruit. This can extend to other members of the
            genus Musa, such as the scarlet banana (Musa coccinea), the pink
            banana (Musa velutina), and the Fe'i bananas. It can also refer to
            members of the genus Ensete, such as the snow banana (Ensete
            glaucum) and the economically important false banana (Ensete
            ventricosum). Both genera are in the banana family, Musaceae.
